Hello, I'm Khai McCaskill.

I was born and raised in Delaware and am a
big baltimore ravens fan.

Currently, I'm a freshman ('26) computer engineering major 
at UD in the Honors College. My interests include 
supercomputing, machine learning, and computer architecture.

I recently joined the UD CRPL project and am working on 
learning the ropes.
