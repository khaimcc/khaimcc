Hello, I'm Khai McCaskill.

I was born and raised on the East Coast of the US and am a
big Baltimore Ravens fan.

Currently, I'm a freshman ('26) computer engineering major 
at UD in the Honors College. My interests include 
supercomputing, machine learning, and computer architecture.

I recently joined the UD CRPL project and am working on 
learning the ropes.
